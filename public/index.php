  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>
    I have a B.S. in Bioinformatics with a minor in Computer Science from VCU.
    I love working with data and coding to solve real-world problems.
    My experience includes schoolwork in acquiring my degree, where I
    developed a strong understanding of coding languages and data management,
    working on projects with large-scale data sets, and creating reports and webpages
    to visualize and analyze data.
    I have a solid foundation in programming and biological data analysis, and I
    am always eager to learn new skills and technologies. I thrive in collaborative
    environments and enjoy working with cross-functional teams to achieve common goals.
    I specialize in PHP, SQL, Python, Java, Docker, R, and data visualization.
    Outside of academics, I have over 10 years of experience as a pharmacy technician,
    where I honed my skills in data management, regulatory compliance, and patient care.
    I love reading, gaming, exercising and exploring new passions and hobbies in my free time.
